   b. The `CLK_PERI` clock, which is derived from this new source frequency, is also affected. To restore it to its original frequency, go to the **System Clocks** tab, select `CLK_PERI`, and set its divider to '1' (instead of '2')

> **Note:** For the `CYUSB2315-BF104AXI` product, to enable UART logging through SCB, follow the steps below:<br>
a. Set the `USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE` macro to `0` in the **Makefile**<br>
b. In **main.c**, modify the SCB configuration by changing `LOGGING_SCB` from `(SCB4)` to `(SCB0)`, `LOGGING_SCB_IDX` from `(4)` to `(0)` and the value of `dbgCfg.dbgIntfce` from `CY_DEBUG_INTFCE_UART_SCB4` to `CY_DEBUG_INTFCE_UART_SCB0`<br>
c. Launch the Device Configurator tool to disable `SCB4`, and enable `SCB0` for UART. Set `921600` baud, `9` Oversample, and use the `16 bit Divider 0 clk` clock


## Compile-time configurations

This application's functionality can be customized by setting variables in *Makefile* or by configuring them through `make` CLI arguments.

- Run the `make build` command or build the project in your IDE to compile the application and generate a USB bootloader-compatible binary. This binary can be programmed onto the EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3 device using the EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center application

- Run the `make build CORE=CM0P` command or set the variable in *Makefile* to compile and generate the binary for the Cortex&reg; M0+ core. By default, `CORE` is set as `CM4` and the binary is compiled and generated for the Cortex&reg; M4 core

- Choose between the **Arm&reg; Compiler** or the **GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler** build toolchains by setting the `TOOLCHAIN` variable in *Makefile* to `ARM` or `GCC_ARM` respectively. If you set it to `ARM`, ensure to set `CY_ARM_COMPILER_DIR` as a make variable or environment variable, pointing to the path of the compiler's root directory

- Run the `make build REV02=no` command or set the variable in *Makefile* to compile the application and generate the binary compatible with the REV01 version of the EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3 kit
> **Note:** If REV02 Kit is used, FPGA is configured using SMIF in x4 or Quad mode else (for REV01) FPGA is configured using SMIF in x1 or Single mode.

By default, the application is configured to receive data from a 16-bit wide LVCMOS interface in SDR mode and make a USBHS data connection. Additional settings can be configured through macros specified by the `DEFINES` variable in *Makefile*:

**Table 1. Macro description**

Macro name        |  Description                          | Allowed values
:--------         | :-------------                        | :------------
BUS_WIDTH_16      | Select the LVCMOS bus width           | 1u for 16-bit <br> 0u for 8-bit bus width
USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE | Enable debug logs through the USBFS port  | 1u for debug logs over USBFS <br> 0u for debug logs over UART (SCB4)

<br>

6. When the **WinUSB** device appears, open **EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center**, navigate to the **Performance Measurement** tab and initiate **BULK OUT Data** transfers on the selected endpoint


## Debugging

### Using the Arm&reg; debug port

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

</details>

### Log messages

By default, the USBFS port is enabled for debug logs.

To enable debug logs on UART, set **USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE** compiler flag to '0u' in *Makefile*. SCB4 of the EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3 device is used as UART with a baud rate of 921,600 to send out log messages through the P11.0 pin.

The verbosity of the debug log output can be modified by setting the **DEBUG_LEVEL** macro in *main.c* file with the following values for debugging:

**Table 2. Debug values**

Macro value     |    Description
:-------------  | :------------
1u              | Enable error messages
2u              | Enable warning messages
3u              | Enable info messages
4u              | Enable all messages
<br>


## Design and implementation

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a Synchronous Slave FIFO interface, where the Sensor Interface Port (SIP) on the EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3 device is connected to an FPGA/Master, enabling read access to the internal FIFO buffers of the EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3 device. This application uses various low-performance peripherals to interface with the system such as:

- I2C master to configure the data source/FPGA/master
- SMIF (in x4 or Quad mode) interface for downloading the FPGA configuration binary on every bootup

> **Note:** If REV02 Kit is used, FPGA is configured using SMIF in x4 or Quad mode else (for REV01) FPGA is configured using SMIF in x1 or Single mode.

- Enable debug prints over CDC using USBFS block on EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3 device


### Features of the application

- **USB specifications:** USB 2.0 (both Hi-Speed and Full-Speed)
- Supports read operation initiated by the FPGA/master device
- Supports read on both the GPIF threads, i.e., GPIF thread '0' and GPIF thread '1'


### Data streaming path

- The device enumerates as a vendor-specific USB device with two Bulk endpoints (1-OUT and 2-OUT)
- The application enables two Bulk, i.e., EP 1-OUT and EP 2-OUT with a maximum packet size of 512 bytes
- The device transmits the data through the following datapaths:

   - **Data Path#1:**  Data is received on EP 1-OUT and sent on LVCMOS Socket 0 (mapped to GPIF Thread 0)
   - **Data Path#2:**  Data is received on EP 2-OUT and sent on LVCMOS socket 1 (mapped to GPIF Thread 1)
- Four DMA buffers of 61440 (60KB) bytes size are used to hold the data while it is being forwarded to the USB


### Application workflow

The application flow involves three main steps:

   - Initialization 
   - USB device enumeration
   - Slave FIFO OUT transfer

#### Initialization

During initialization, the following steps are performed:
1. All the required data structures are initialized
2. USBD and USB driver (CAL) layers are initialized
3. Application registers all descriptors supported by function/application with the USBD layer
4. Application registers callback functions for different events like `RESET`, `SUSPEND`, `RESUME`, `SET_CONFIGURATION`, `SET_INTERFACE`, `SET_FEATURE`, and `CLEAR_FEATURE`. USBD will call the respective callback function when the corresponding events are detected
5. Initialize the data transfer state machines
6. Application registers handlers for all relevant interrupts
7. Application makes the USB device visible to the host by calling the Connect API
8. FPGA is configured using the SMIF (in x4 or quad mode) block to read the bit file stored in the external flash. FPGA sees the data on bus and gets configured
	> **Note:** If REV02 Kit is used, FPGA is configured using SMIF in x4 or Quad mode else (for REV01) FPGA is configured using SMIF in x1 or Single mode
9. FPGA is initialized using I2C writes to FPGA registers
10. Application initializes the SIP block on EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3 as required by the selected LVCMOS operating mode


#### USB device enumeration

1. During USB device enumeration, the host requests for descriptors that are already registered with the USBD layer during the initialization phase
2. The host sends the `SET_CONFIGURATION` and `SET_INTERFACE` commands to activate the required function in the device
3. After the `SET_CONFIGURATION` and `SET_INTERFACE` commands, the application task takes control and enables the endpoints for data transfer


#### Slave FIFO OUT transfer

- Depending on the compile-time options, LVCMOS Interface, 16-bit bus width are selected
- Once the data transfers are initiated from the host application, FPGA/Master is configured to the stream data. DMA ready flag on the SIP interface asserts and the FPGA data sink starts reading the data from the FX2G3 device
- Data moves from the USB EP OUT to SRAM through high-bandwidth DMA to the LVCMOS subsystem
- The data is forwarded to the LVCMOS bus. DataWire DMA channels are used in the case of USBHS transfers

#### Slave FIFO interface
The Synchronous Slave FIFO interface connections are as follows:

**Table 3. Control signal usage in LVCMOS Slave FIFO state machine**

FX2G3 pin         | Function            | Description

## FPGA configuration
FPGA configuration is done using the SMIF Block of FX2G3. SMIF (in x4 or Quad mode) interface is used for downloading the FPGA configuration binary on every bootup
Steps to configure FPGA (in Passive serialx4 mode)
- FX2G3 deasserts INT_RESET pin
- FX2G3 starts sending dummy SMIF (in x4 or Quad mode) clock to read the FPGA BitFile from SPI flash
- FPGA listens to the data on the SMIF lines and configures itself
- FPGA asserts CDONE# when configuration is complete

**Table 5. GPIOs for configuring FPGA on KIT_FX2G3_104LGA DVK**
FX2G3 Pin        | Function            | Description
:-------------   | :------------       | :--------------
