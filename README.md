## Operation

1. Connect the board (J2) to your PC using the provided USB cable. Connect the USBFS port (J7) on the board to PC for debug logs.

2. Open a terminal program and select the Serial COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 921600 baud.

3. Follow these steps to program the board using the **EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center** (Alpha) application.
      
   1. Open **EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center** application.

      The **EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3** device displays as **EZ-USB FX BOOTLOADER**.

   2. Follow these sub steps to program the FPGA binary on to the external flash.
   
      a. Navigate to **Device Selection** > **Devices**, select **EZ-USB FX BOOTLOADER**, and then click the **Program** > **Internal Flash** option.

      b. Browse the [mtb-example-fx2g3-flash-loader application] (https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-fx2g3-flash-loader) application and navigate to the /build/APP_KIT_FX2G3_104LGA/Release/ folder within the application directory and locate the *.hex* file and program.

      c. Select the **FX2G3 Flash loader** device in the **EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center**.

      d. Click **Program** > **External Flash** option.

      e. Browse the FPGA binary file in the *\<CE Title>/BitFile* folder based on the configuration.

   3. Once the FPGA binary programming is successful, return to the USB bootloader mode.
      
      Once the firmware binary has been programmed onto the FX2G3 device flash, the bootloader will keep transferring control to the application on every subsequent reset.

   4. To return the control to USB bootloader, press **BOOT MODE/PMODE (SW1)** switch on **KIT_FX2G3_104LGA DVK**. 
   
      While the device is reset or power cycled, the device will stay in the bootloader mode instead of booting into the application.

   5. Select **FX Bootloader** device in **EZ-USB&trade; FX Control Center** and click the **Program** > **Internal Flash** option.

   6. Navigate to the /build/APP_KIT_FX2G3_104LGA/Release/ folder within the CE directory and locate the *.hex* file and program.

   7. Confirm if the programming is successful in the log window of the application.

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "\<CE Title>" is displayed on the UART terminal.

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/terminal-fx2g3-slave-fifo-out.png)

   The device will enumerate as a WinUSB device.

5. Open the application, go to the **Performance Measurement** tab and initiate **BULK OUT Data** transfers on the selected endpoint.

## Logging configurations

By default, the USBFS port is enabled for debug logs.
To enable debug logs on UART, set **USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE** compiler flag to '0u' in the *makefile*. SCB4 of the FX2G3 device is used as UART with a baud rate of 921,600 to send out log messages through the P11.0 pin.

## Debugging

Debug the code example by setting debug levels for the UART logs. Set the **DEBUG_LEVEL** macro in *main.c* file with the following values for debugging.

**Table 1. Debug values**

Macro value     |    Description
:-------------  | :------------
1u              | Enable error messages
2u                  | Enable warning messages
3u              | Enable info messages
4u                | Enable all messages

## Design and implementation

This code example demonstrates the implementation of the synchronous Slave FIFO interface, where sensor interface port (SIP) on FX2G3 is interfaced with an FPGA/Master, which can perform read access to internal FIFO buffers of FX2G3. This application uses various low-performance peripherals to interface with the system such as:

- I2C master to configure the FPGA/master
- SMIF (in x1 or single mode) interface for downloading of the FPGA configuration binary on every bootup
- Enable debug prints over CDC using USBFS block on FX2G3 

### Features of the application
- **USB specifications:** USB 2.0 (both Hi-Speed and Full-Speed)
- Supports read operation initiated by the FPGA/master device
- Supports read on both the GPIF threads i.e., GPIF thread 0 and GPIF thread 1

### Datapath
- The device enumerates as a vendor specific USB device with two Bulk endpoint (1-OUT and 2-OUT)
- The application enables two Bulk i.e., EP-1 OUT and EP-2 OUT with maximum packet size of 512 bytes
- The device transmits the data through the following datapaths:
   - **Data Path#1:**  Data is received on EP 1-OUT and sent on LVCMOS Socket 0 (mapped to GPIF Thread 0)
   - **Data Path#2:**  Data is received on EP 2-OUT and sent on LVCMOS Socket 1 (mapped to GPIF Thread 1)
- Four DMA buffers of 16384 (16KB) bytes size are used to hold the data while it is being forwarded to the USB.

### Application workflow

The application flow involves three steps - Initialization, USB device enumeration, and Slave FIFO OUT transfer.

#### Initialization
During initialization, the following steps are performed:
1. All the required data structures are initialized.
2. USBD and USB driver (CAL) layers are initialized.
3. Application registers all descriptors supported by function/application with the USBD layer.
4. Application registers callback functions for different events like RESET, SUSPEND, RESUME, SET_CONFIGURATION, SET_INTERFACE, SET_FEATURE, and CLEAR_FEATURE. USBD will call the respective callback function when the corresponding events are detected.
5. Initialize the data transfer state machines.
6. Application registers handlers for all relevant interrupts.
7. Application makes the USB device visible to the host by calling the Connect API.
8. FPGA is configured using the SMIF (in x1 or single mode) block to read the bit file stored in the external flash. FPGA sees the data on bus and gets configured.
9. FPGA is initialized using I2C writes to FPGA registers.
10. Application initializes the SIP block on FX2G3 as required by the selected LVCMOS operating mode.

#### USB device enumeration
1. During USB device enumeration, the host requests for descriptors which are already registered with the USBD layer during the initialization phase.
2. Host will send SET_CONFIGURATION command and SET_INTERFACE commands to activate required function in the device.
3. After SET_CONFIGURATION and SET_INTERFACE command, the application task takes control and enables the endpoints for data transfer.

#### Slave FIFO OUT transfer
- Depending on the compile-time options, LVCMOS Interface , 16-bit bus width are selected
- Once the data transfers are initiated from the host application, FPGA/master is configured to the stream data. DMA ready flag on the SIP interface asserts and the FPGA data sink starts reading the data from the FX2G3 device
- Data moves from the USB EP OUT to SRAM through High Bandwidth DMA to the LVCMOS subsystem
- The data is forwarded on the LVCMOS bus. DataWire DMA channels are used in the case of USBHS transfers.

### Compile-time configurations

This application's functionality can be customized through the compile-time parameters that can be turned ON or OFF through the *makefile*.
The application uses the GNU Arm&reg; 11.3 toolchain, which is part of the ModusToolbox&trade; installation for compilation.
- Run the `make` command to compile the application and generate a USB bootloader compatible binary. This binary can be programmed to the FX2G3 device using the EZ-USB&trade; Control Center application.
- Run the `make BLENABLE=no` command to compile the application and generate the standalone binary. This binary can be programmed onto the FX2G3 device through the SWD interface using the OpenOCD tool. For more details, see the [EZ-USB&trade; FX2G3 SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/ez-usb-fx2g3/#main-features-comparison).

By default, the application is configured to receive data from a 16-bit wide LVCMOS interface in SDR mode and make a USBHS data connection. These settings can be modified by modifying settings in the *makefile*.

**Table 2. Macro description**

Macro name        |    Description                            | Allowed values
:-------------    | :------------                             | :--------------
BUS_WIDTH_16      | Select the LVCMOS bus width               | 1u for 16-bit. <br> 0u for 8-bit bus width.
USBFS_LOGS_ENABLE | Enable debug logs through USBFS port      | 1u for debug logs over USBFS. <br> 0u for debug logs over UART (SCB4).
